Question 3:

3a) Write a simple block of Python code that (a) reads the input file (and all of its transactions)
and (b) calculates the average transaction amount across all records.

import pandas as pd

# Path to your CSV file
file_path = "transactions.csv"

# Read the CSV into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Calculate the average transaction amount
average_amount = df['TransactionAmount'].mean()

print(f"Average Transaction Amount: {average_amount}")


#3b) If this file were to be saved in a GCS bucket, how could you access it from BigQuery?

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE project_id.dataset_id.table_name
(
    Transaction_dt DATE,
    Description STRING,
    transactionAmount FLOAT64
)
OPTIONS (
    format = 'csv',
    uris = ['gs://<path_to_file>'],
    field_delimiter = ',', 
    skip_leading_rows = 1, 
);

#Question 4) Write a code snippet that generates the square of every element in the list lst in
#a pythonic way.

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_lst = [x**2 for x in lst]
print(squared_lst)

#Question 5) Given an integer array nums, write a Python function that returns True if the
#array has duplicates. Otherwise, the function should return False.

def duplicates_check(nums):
    return len(nums) != len(set(nums))
